
there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it  a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and the talking over its head very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mind

the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it  no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming theres plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table

have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone

alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea i dont see any wine she remarked

there isnt any said the march hare

then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily

it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare

i didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great many more than three

your hair wants cutting said the hatter he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech

you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity its very rude
